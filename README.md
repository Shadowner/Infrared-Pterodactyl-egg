# Infrared for Pterodactyl ! 
Here is an egg that can be used with the Panel of Pterodactyl.

What is Infrared ?

They explain it better than me : 
[https://infrared.dev/](https://infrared.dev/)

TLDR; It'a reverse proxy for minecraft that allow you to only have one shown port for all your servers. Making redirections to the right server based on the subdomain associated with the server.

## How to use it ?

1. Download the desired egg from the `eggs` folder.
2. Upload it to your panel.
3. Create a new server with the egg you just uploaded.
4. Setup the environment variables as needed by the egg.
5. Start the server.

## Warning : 
Actually the Infrared server doesn't stop when the stop button is pressed on the panel. You have to kill the server to let it shutdown.
