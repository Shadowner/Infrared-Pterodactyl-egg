# EGGS Instruction

If you want to extend the number of Proxy just duplication the "Proxy #1 Domains / Addresses" and change the variable name / Environment variable name. 
And increment the PROXY_COUNT variable.

For now it's the only way to extend the number of Proxy.

## In the future

In the future, I will try to create a new interface for any Infrared Eggs to add / handle new Proxies.
